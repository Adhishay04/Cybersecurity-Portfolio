# 🚨 Incident Report Analysis

This project documents the analysis of a cybersecurity incident involving a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on a fictional multimedia company. The company suffered a two-hour outage due to a flood of ICMP packets that overwhelmed their internal network.

Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), the incident is analyzed across five key functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

## 📌 Scenario Overview

The organization experienced a DDoS attack caused by a malicious actor exploiting an unconfigured firewall, allowing an ICMP flood into the network. This attack temporarily disrupted internal services until mitigated.

As a cybersecurity analyst, I evaluated the response and created a strategy to help the company improve its defenses and incident management process.
